            <h1> The problem </h1>
            <p>Spark only supports Nodejs versions 8 and higher. This is because we use the promise and async/await features.
            Although version 7 supports this, it's only used in an experimental stage and only works with experimental flags. This is we choose to not support this version at all to prevent basic errors.</p>
            <h1> The Solution</h1>
            <p> Simply go to the Nodejs website and download the latest installer.</p>

            </a>
            <p> We assume you know how to do this because you have at least done this once before.</p>
            <p> If you're not succeeding please Google around for some up to date guides.</p>
